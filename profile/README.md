[CATIE](https://www.catie.fr) (Centre Aquitain des Technologies de l’Information et Électroniques) is a non-profit organization created in 2014 based in the Région Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

As a technology resource center specialized in digital technology, our main mission is to support SMEs and intermediate size companies in their digital transformation and to help them embrace and integrating related technologies.
We also work on research projects with public laboratories and digital technologies experts (startups, large companies…) and frequently participate in EU-founded projects.

Strategically located in the center of the Bordeaux University campus, CATIE is closely connected with both local academic research centers and regional companies, as well as with students.

CATIE offers an unusual multidisciplinary approach based on three main competence areas, each of which being supported by a dedicated department:

- Human Factors and Cognition,
- Data Science (Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain)
- Embedded Electronics.

CATIE fulfills its missions by participating in research and transfer programs, but also by implementing open and collaborative “Technological Innovation Platforms”, i.e., experimental environments to develop and transfer new technologies to companies.
[6TRON](https://6tron.io) focuses on the Internet of Things, while the other two address Artificial Intelligence ([VANIILA](https://vaniila.ai)) and Behavioral and Cognitive Assessment ([PEAC²H](https://www.peac2h.io/)), for a better integration of humans in the acceptability of complex and innovative systems.
